## Design Proposal
### Initial ideas:
* sun rotating around a fixed point incremented by 365 up to (and beyond) 1000
* sun is made with concentric turtles
* background is a blend of black/purple/grey/space colours
* background blends from light to dark at various points throughout the sequence
* earth is the fixed point
* earth changes colour depending on 'seasons'
* varying number of unit circles as stars
* size of sun scales with size of image
* size of sun changes also with image number
* earth can be square of blue and green pixels, scalable using image-scale (or something like that)
* different colour pallettes: eg. dusk, pastelle, neon
